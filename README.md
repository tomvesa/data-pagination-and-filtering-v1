FSJS Project 2 - Data Pagination and Filtering

- task => create a page as in the mockup with pagination of 9 cards on a page
- data comming from the js/data.js file 
- add page buttons to display cards that belong to that page
- create a search function to match name of the person
- search function to use the pagination as well.


> 1. create render HTML elements
    > cards , search button , No result found message
    
> 2. pagination function => using dataset attribute
      this way we work with data we loaded in first place, 
      And we do not need to remove and load them again.
      Use css class to hide / display
> 3.  search function => reset dataset to have pagination working
      for found results
